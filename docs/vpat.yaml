                There is a Google reCaptcha embedded function to prevent or
                mitigate spammer registering influx. We acknowledge the lack of
                full support for accessibility to this feature since we rely on
                the functionality of a third-party vendor, i.e. Google. This
                plugin is optional and it is disabled by default.

                The theme uses ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page. It
                misses only the footer region element although it presents an
                alternative to reach the footer content.

                Most of elements present a minimum contrast Ratio of 4.57:1 that
                complies to WCA 2.1 AA. The asterisk "*" element in input files
                that denotes "required input" has now the color contrast and the
                font size to comply to this criteria. The remediation can be
                seen from this Issue in Github:

                The Default Theme enables small screen users to read content in
                both orientation : landscape or portrait, without requiring
                horizontal scrolling. 

                It also relies on content, especially images that editors may
                upload. As long as they respect the maximum width it will be
                compliant to this criteria.

                A contrast ratio of 6.18:1 is provided to the icons utilized in
                buttons (PDF, XML, HTML galleys) and search. This number relies
                on the color of the theme out-of-box. Journal managers can
                adjust or customize the colors of the interface. That action may
                change the contrast ratio and turn the interface non-compliant.

                Main menu items are "hoverable". It means that when the pointer
                hovers a menu item with child menu, it will trigger the
                additional content. Also, the pointer can be moved over the
                additional content without the additional content disappearing.
